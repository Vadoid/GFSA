      },
      "2. FOUNDER & TEAM ASSESSMENT": {
        "Founder Background and Strengths/Weaknesses": "The 'about us' page on LinkedIn is a generic login page, and the 'team' page on the Good With website only provides team photos. Without specific information on the founders' backgrounds (e.g., LinkedIn profiles, press releases), it's impossible to assess their strengths and weaknesses. Researching their LinkedIn profiles is crucial.",
        "Team Composition Analysis": "The team page displays a team photo, but lacks details on roles, responsibilities, and expertise. A thorough analysis requires understanding the team's skills in psychology, finance, technology (app development, data science), marketing, and business development.",
        "Technical Expertise Assessment": "Without details on the technology team, it's difficult to assess their technical expertise. Key areas to evaluate include mobile app development (iOS and Android), backend infrastructure, data security, and data analysis/machine learning.",
        "Leadership Capabilities": "Cannot be assessed without information on the founders and key management personnel.",
        "Key Management Gaps": "Likely gaps include experienced Fintech operators, marketing specialists focused on digital user acquisition, and potentially, a dedicated CTO or VP of Engineering if the founders are not technically focused.",
        "Hiring Priorities": [
          "Mobile App Developers (iOS and Android): To maintain and improve the app.",
          "Data Scientist: To analyze user data and personalize the experience.",

          "Customer Support Specialist: To handle user inquiries and provide support."
        ],
        "Team Dynamics and Culture Observations": "Impossible to determine without more information. The team photo suggests a collaborative and friendly culture, but this requires further validation."
      },
      "3. MARKET ANALYSIS": {

The personal finance management market is also substantial and growing.",
        "Serviceable Obtainable Market": "The SOM is more focused, targeting young adults (Gen Z and Millennials) in the UK who are experiencing financial stress and seeking solutions for better money management and mental well-being.
