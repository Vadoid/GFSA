*   **Unit Economics:**
    *   *Information Gap:* No public data on CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), CLTV (Customer Lifetime Value), or Churn.
    *   *Key Considerations:* Need to ensure CLTV >> CAC. Factors influencing this include pricing, contract length, customer retention (churn rate), and upsell potential. Proving ROI (e.g., the claimed $500k savings for a 500-employee company) is key to justifying price and retaining clients.

**6. FINANCIAL SITUATION**

*   **Current Funding Stage:** Pre-Seed.
    *   Raised a total of Â£950K (~â‚¬1.1M) in a pre-seed round concluded around Sept/Oct 2024.
    *   Lead Investor: Fuel Ventures.
    *   Other Investors: Look AI Ventures, Loyal VC, SeedBlink, APX, Pi Labs, Veridian Ventures, Plug and Play.
*   **Key Financial Metrics:**
    *   *Information Gap:* No public information on MRR/ARR, burn rate, profitability, customer numbers (beyond a few named examples like Uber, BSC Consulting, Uplink).
    *   *Implied Metrics:* Based on client results cited (20% attrition drop, 40% stress absence drop), they are likely tracking these impact metrics closely for validation.
*   **Resource Allocation:**
    *   Given the recent funding and early stage, resources are likely prioritized towards:
        1.  Product Development: Enhancing AI capabilities (both analytics and conversation simulation), platform features, UI/UX.
        2.  Sales & Marketing: Acquiring initial customers, building brand awareness, developing case studies.
        3.  Team Expansion: Hiring key technical and potentially commercial roles.
